Question D.

1. Θ(x^2), only the degree-setting term matters


2. O(logx), take 2x^2 common inside the log, and split it into two terms. Ignore constant terms and scaling factors


3. Θ(n^2), the total number of increments = 1 + 2 + .... + N-1 + N = N(N-1)/2


4. Θ(M+N), Worst case run time is when bump is always false, and loop never breaks. In this case, there are a total
of M + N increments.


5. Θ(n^2), the run time of f1 is linear
